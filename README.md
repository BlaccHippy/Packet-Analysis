# Packet-Capture w/Wireshark 

## Objective

The Coursera Wireshark project provided tools to learn how to troubleshoot with Wireshark, capture Traffic and analyze already captured Traffic. Practice how to use Display and Capture Filters. Generate, Capture then analyze SSH and HTTPS encrypted Traffic. Decrypt HTTPS Traffic in Wireshark. Generate, Capture and analyze RADIUS, DNS, HTTP and Telnet unencrypted Traffic. Also, I worked on decrypting the RADIUS encrypted password.

### Skills Learned
Using Wireshark and most of its basic functionalities: capturing network traffic that is flowing through virtual machine and analyzing already captured network traffic by opening stored packet capture files.

Generating and capturing RADIUS Traffic, analyzing it and viewing it in Wireshark. Knowing what the RADIUS Architecture consists of and decrypting the encrypted password with the shared secret using Wireshark.

Knowing the basics about HTTP, and knowing the difference between Wiresharkâ€™s Capture and Display Filters. Connecting to a HTTP Server and initiate a Basic HTTP Authentication and capturing its Traffic on Wireshark, analyzing the captured packets and seeing the username and password being sent.

Initiating a HTTP Form-based authentication, capturing it in Wireshark and analyzing it so you can see the username and password clearly. Also Capturing DNS Traffic.

Knowing how Telnet works, starting a Telnet Session with a remote Device using Powershell, capturing its traffic in Wireshark and analyzing it from the Security perspective.

Opening a SSH Session with the same Device as Telnet session, capturing the traffic and comparing it with the Telnet Packet Capture. Capturing traffic based on the host involved and how to see all the host, packet and protocol statistics as well as conversations that have happened in a certain capture

### Tools Used
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
